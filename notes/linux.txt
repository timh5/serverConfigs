How to use symlinks in a chrooted environment like in FTP...
For example, if user ftp's in, then a symlink -> /var/www/html wont work
because the "/" root is different in the chrooted environment.
To fix use:

mkdir /home/user/blah.com
mount --bind /var/www/vhosts/blah.com /home/user/blah.com




Mirroring a website:
wget --mirror -w 2 -p --html-extension --convert-links -P <dir_prefix> http://www.yourdomain.com

	-w N	wait N seconds between loads
	-p		get all prerequisites
	-r		recursive
	-l N	specify levels of recusrion, 0=infinite
	-k,--convert-links	convert to relative/local links
	-E		add html extension
	-N
	--mirror = -r -N -l inf --no-remove-listing

## Union, Intersect, Differences of files
It is remarkably helpful sometimes that you can do set intersection, union, and difference of text files via sort/uniq. Suppose a and b are text files that are already uniqued. This is fast, and works on files of arbitrary size, up to many gigabytes. (Sort is not limited by memory, though you may need to use the -T option if /tmp is on a small root partition.)

cat a b | sort | uniq > c   # c is a union b
cat a b | sort | uniq -d > c   # c is a intersect b
cat a b b | sort | uniq -u > c   # c is set difference a - b
